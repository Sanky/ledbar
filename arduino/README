autonomous.pde: This is autonomous LED controller that implements several
simple color cycling algorithms directly on Ardiuno - no host controller
is required. All LEDs have the same color. Useful for testing.

controlled.pde: Listens to a byte stream on serial. The byte stream should
contain one R,G,B tribyte per LED, sent repeatedly.
